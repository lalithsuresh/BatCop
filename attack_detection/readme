** Readme for detect_flood.sh

Usage:
attack_detection/detect_flood.sh

Output:
-if no attacks are detected it will output "** Boring network, no attacks detected."
-if attacks are detected they will be written to the file "log/alert" in standard snort format , for example:
	11/27-09:01:45.825956  [**] [1:477000:3] ICMP flood detected [**] [Priority: 0] {ICMP} 192.168.206.1 -> 192.168.206.133
-there can be multiple lines of output depending on the volume of the attack but the "detect_flood.sh" script will only output unique attack sources


Note:
There are two rules in the myrules.conf file. However more rules can be added easily to detect more types of floods.
	Rule 1 (ICMP echo flood detection):
		It creates an alert if the number of ICMP echo requests being received in 5 seconds is greater than 50
	Rule 2 (TCP flood detection):
		It creates an alert if the number of TCP packets being uploaded in 5 seconds is equal to or greater than 50. 
		This rule will detect TCP SYN flood and TCP ACK flood because in both attacks the TCP upload is abnormally huge.
		This rule assumes that the TCP upload traffic for a normal user is never greater than 50 packets per 5 seconds.
		There will false positives if the user is using a file sharing application.
