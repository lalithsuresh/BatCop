Welcome to BatCop v.01
----------------------

BatCop is a tool derived from Intel PowerTOP. PowerTop
was designed to spot applications that were consuming
too much power. Although initially designed to be a
diagnosis tool, we decided PowerTOP can be used for much
more than that. We thus present, BatCop, a battery attack
detection system. The equation leading to BatCop is as follows:

We leverage upon the diagnosis capabilities of PowerTOP, 
perform our own statistical analysis of the values reported by
PowerTOP's IRQ monitoring system, and detect anomalies in the
power consumption profiles of each application.

To train BatCop:

$: sudo batcop --mode=0

Leave this running for a while to let BatCop analyse the
current profile of the running system. The more data it collects,
the stronger it's guess will be when it attempts to monitor
the system later on for anomalies. Terminating the program
will lead to a trace file being generated. This can be used
as an input for the monitor mode operation.

To monitor the system using BatCop:

$: sudo batcop --mode=1 --file=<dump_file>

To do both, (not stable as far as verdicts are concerned):

$: sudo batcop --mode=2
