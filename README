Welcome to BatCop v.01
----------------------

BatCop is a tool derived from Intel PowerTOP. PowerTop
was designed to spot applications that were consuming
too much power. Although initially designed to be a
diagnosis tool, we decided PowerTOP can be used for much
more than that. We thus present, BatCop, a battery attack
detection system.

We leverage upon the diagnosis capabilities of PowerTOP, 
add a bit more of our own (e.g, CPU consumption monitoring),
perform statistical analysis of the values reported by
the monitoring engine, and detect anomalies in the
working profiles of each application.

To train BatCop:

$: sudo batcop --mode=0 --cycles=<number of training cycles>

Leave this running for a while to let BatCop analyse the
current profile of the running system. The more data it collects,
the stronger it's guess will be when it attempts to monitor
the system later on for anomalies. This can be used
as an input for the monitor mode operation.

To monitor the system using BatCop:

$: sudo batcop --mode=1 --file=<dump_file> --cbfile=<callback_file> --whitefile=<whitelist> --logfile=<logfile>

To see an example <callback_file>, look at conf/temp.conf.
The whitelist is a list of process names that are to be ignored
by BatCop. Logfile defaults to stderr.
